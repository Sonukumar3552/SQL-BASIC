## Overview

This repository is designed to help learners grasp the core concepts of SQL using MySQL. The included SQL scripts demonstrate how to:

- Create and manage databases and tables  
- Populate data via insertion  
- Retrieve and analyze data using `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `BETWEEN`, `IN`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING` clauses  
- Perform aggregate operations (`COUNT`, `MAX`, etc.)  
- Update and delete data safely, including awareness of `'safe update'` mode in MySQL

## Features

- Sample SQL script (`Classroom.sql`) illustrating:
  - Database and table creation  
  - Data CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)  
  - Advanced query filtering and sorting  
  - Aggregation and grouping techniques  
  - Safe update practices  

## Prerequisites

- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) installed on your machine  
- A MySQL client or interface (e.g., command-line, MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin)

## Setup Instructions

### Importing the SQL Scripts

1. Open your MySQL client.
2. Create a new database:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE sql_basic_tutorial;
   USE sql_basic_tutorial;
````

3. Run or import the `Classroom.sql` file:

   ```bash
   mysql -u <your_username> -p sql_basic_tutorial < Classroom.sql
   ```

### Running Queries

Once the script is imported, explore by executing example queries:

```sql
-- Select all rows
SELECT * FROM your_table_name;

-- Filter using WHERE, BETWEEN, IN
SELECT * FROM your_table_name
WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2
  AND other_column IN (valueA, valueB)
  ORDER BY some_column;

-- Aggregation with GROUP BY, HAVING
SELECT group_column, COUNT(*) AS total
FROM your_table_name
GROUP BY group_column
HAVING total > 1;
```

## Usage Examples

Here are some illustrative queries:

```sql
-- Count students in each class
SELECT class_name, COUNT(*) AS student_count
FROM students
GROUP BY class_name
HAVING student_count > 10;

-- Find maximum score in a test
SELECT MAX(score) AS highest_score FROM test_results;
```

*(Replace `students`, `class_name`, `students`, `test_results`, `score`, etc., with your actual table/column names.)*
